//this code is written by satinder singh, and you are allowed to use or modify this code
//you can make a bluetooth controllled arduino based fan and light controller
//it is a really easy project and anyone can make it within 2 hours 
//you can just upload the code make and connect the components and you are ready to go.


//the connections are as follows:
//digital pin 11(in my case):to arduino and connect the shield to the arduino
