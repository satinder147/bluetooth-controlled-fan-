# bluetooth-controlled-fan and light
with this you can remotely control you rooms fans and lights 
it is a very simple arduino project which you can implement with a hour if you are familiar with arduino 

all you need for this project are:
1)phone
2)arduino (i used arduino uno)
3)bluethooth module(i used HC 05)
4)small servo motor
5)jumper wires
6)pc to write your code

*******connections
for bluetooth module(rx pin of bluetooth module to tx pin of arduino and tx pin of bluetooth module to rx pin of arduino
                     vcc to 5v pin and gnd to ground pin on arduino)
                     
                     
                     
                     *******remove the tx and rx pin from arduino while uploading the code 
                     
                    
                    then i connected the shield to the arduino and then the servo to the shield
